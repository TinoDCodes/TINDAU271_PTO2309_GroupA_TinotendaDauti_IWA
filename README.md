# Book Connect

Book Connect is a social media platform specifically designed for book enthusiasts. The platform was initially developed by a freelance developer, and has now been improved and is running as intended.

## :beginner: Description

Book Connect allows users to discover new books to read. Users can view a list of book previews, each with a title, author, and associated image. They can also read a summary of each book, see the date it was published, and find books based on specific text phrases. Users can filter books by author or genre, and toggle between dark and light modes for comfortable use at any time of day.

## :wrench: User Stories

The following user stories have been addressed to achieve the desired functionality:

- As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.
- As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.
- As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.
- As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand.
- As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I donâ€™t need to remember the entire title of a book.
- As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night.
